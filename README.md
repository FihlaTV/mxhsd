# mxhsd

## Status
`mxhsd` has been abandoned as a strictly-compliant Matrix Homeserver.  
[Gridepo](https://github.com/kamax-grid/gridepo) will take over as a dual-stack Grid/Matrix server.

At time of writing, given the inability to implement and document a functional Matrix protocol by
[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) and resolve security vulnerabilities that are public
for years, we felt a re-focus in a more suitable protocol was best.

The produced code will remain public for posterity under [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
